# Web Resources List

A list of frameworks, libraries, tools or anything other resource that might come in handy when developing. Feel free to suggest new entries to the list !

I am listing them in Star-like order where the ones I like the most as visual, code or idea/functionality are with more stars and ones that seems usefull but are badly implemented, ugly or buggy have lower stars count. With time some might move between the stars :)

## Scripts, styles, libs and frameworks

### 5 star :star: :star: :star: :star:

- [Responsify.js](http://responsifyjs.space/#demo) - Responsive images by defining primary area of focus. ( needs to be more researched on how it works)
