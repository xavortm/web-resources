# Web Resources List

A list of frameworks, libraries, tools or anything other resource that might come in handy when developing. Feel free to suggest new entries to the list !

I am listing them in Star-like order where the ones I like the most as visual, code or idea/functionality are with more stars and ones that seems usefull but are badly implemented, ugly or buggy have lower stars count. With time some might move between the stars :)

## Scripts, styles, libs and frameworks
---

 - [Select2](https://select2.github.io/examples.html#multiple-max) - Seems simply awesome - complete control over quite the extensive select boxes.
 - [Bricklayer](http://bricklayer.js.org/) - A very very basic pinterest like layout. it uses almost no JS at all for positioning but instead I think its moving the elements in the DOM. (not sure if its the best solution tho)
 - [Modaal](http://humaan.com/modaal/) - Very nice looking modal script
 - [Responsify.js](http://responsifyjs.space/#demo) - Responsive images by defining primary area of focus. ( needs to be more researched on how it works)
 - [Distorted button effects](http://tympanus.net/Development/DistortedButtonEffects/) - Some very neat button effects.
 - [iCheck](http://icheck.fronteed.com/) - Checkbox stylings
 - [Vue Multiselect](http://monterail.github.io/vue-multiselect/) - The most complete selecting solution for Vue.js


## Tools (npm stuff mainly)

## Fonts
---

 - [Aktiv Grotesk](https://typekit.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk-std) - Amazingly nice looking sans-serif font for body text and headings.
